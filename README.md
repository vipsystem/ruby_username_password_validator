This Ruby program prompts for a username and password and validates that they meet the following criteria:

The username should:
- contain alpha numeric characters (no spaces or special characters)
- contain at least 1 uppercase character
- contain at least 1 lowercase character
- contain at least 1 numeric character (0-9)
- have at least 8 characters long

The password should:
- be at least 8 characters long
- only contain alpha numeric characters (no spaces or special characters)
- contain at least 1 uppercase character
- contain at least 1 lowercase character
- contain at least 1 numeric character (0-9)
- not contain a user’s username (i.e. the username “TomKat5″ is valid, but the password “TomKat5Password” is not valid because it contains the string “TomKat5″)
